# ChatDev Lite (VibeGraph, MASFactory Port)

This directory contains a MASFactory-based **ChatDev Lite** workflow built with **VibeGraph**: each “phase” is a subgraph generated from a natural-language `build_instructions` file, compiled into runnable MASFactory graphs, then executed to produce a small software project.

Workflow phases:

- `DemandAnalysis` → decide product modality
- `LanguageChoose` → pick programming language
- `Coding` → generate runnable multi-file code
- `TestLoop` (`TestErrorSummary` → `TestModification`) → execute the generated code, summarize failures, and apply fixes (up to 3 iterations)

```

## Setup

Run from the repo root:

```bash
uv sync

export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
# Use either one (different entrypoints read different names).
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
# export BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"

export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"
```

## Run

```bash
uv run python applications/chatdev_lite_vibegraph/main.py \
  --task "Write a simple Pong game in Python with a GUI." \
  --name "PingPong" \
  --org "DefaultOrganization" \
  --model "${OPENAI_MODEL_NAME:-gpt-4o-mini}"
```

Outputs are written to `applications/chatdev_lite_vibegraph/assets/output/WareHouse/<project>_<org>_<timestamp>/`.

## AML (Human-in-the-loop)

VibeGraph builds each phase from an **AML** artifact. This is the main human interaction surface for iterating on the workflow structure.

- Cached AML workflows live in `applications/chatdev_lite_vibegraph/assets/cache/aml/*.aml` and are compiled directly on subsequent runs.
- If a cache file is missing, VibeGraph runs the build workflow to regenerate it; during this step you may be prompted to **review/edit the AML** (via MASFactory Visualizer in VS Code if available, otherwise via CLI) and type `AGREE` to accept.
- After editing any `assets/build_instructions/*.txt`, delete the corresponding `*.aml` cache file to force a rebuild with your updated instructions.
